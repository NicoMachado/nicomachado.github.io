Data capture application for mobile devices that allows the upload of data to be analyzed
and processed in the test management system.

On Android, I develop a data logging application for mobile devices, allowing them reduce errors, and speed process of data entry in more than 200%.
Using Room to store data locally and import/export data using RestAPI.
